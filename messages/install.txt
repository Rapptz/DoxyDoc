Hello.

Thanks for installing this package. This package was made to help make
the hassle of making doxygen documentation a little bit easier. There
were many plug-ins that did this for other languages, but there weren't
many that did it for C++ properly. Many failed when handling templates.
As a result, this package was made with high inspiration from the other
popular documentation package, DocBlockr.

If you find any bugs, which are sure to show up due to the imperfections
of parsing C++ with regex, please notify me on the GitHub page:
